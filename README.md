# Cade‚Äôs Python Cookiecutter (cookiecutter-python)

How I work with python, roughly. Bootstrap projects to eliminate toil.

## Objectives

* Cede formatting control to black, it does a fine job and let‚Äôs me focus on code rather than style
* Pytest on push, don‚Äôt let me push code that fails tests
* Enforce strict static type analysis via mypy; duck typing is convenient but tracing obscure issues later sucks
* Use flake8 for pattern feedback but ignore style issues (black)
* Use isort for well ordered imports
* Provide templates for common tasks
* Pre-commit works great, always use it

## Install

[Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io) is required to use this cookiecutter template (üòâ). There are many ways to [install cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.2/installation.html), choose what works best for you. I use [brew](https://brew.sh/) (`brew install cookiecutter`), but it‚Äôs not the only way.

## Usage

```
cookiecutter https://github.com/cadeef/cookiecutter-python.git
```

Cookiecutter‚Äôs documentation is a bit lackluster (I might jump in to help one of these days); a couple tips for using [personal configuration](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.2/advanced/user_config.html) via `.cookiecutterrc` effectively:

### Default Context

Cookiecutter supports default contexts, as they call them, to provide answers for common questions. Unfortunately, it lacks a specification that suggests expected/reusable variables, so I‚Äôve implemented what makes sense to me. My `.cookiecutterrc` looks kinda like this (email address obscured, but feel free to email me if you‚Äôre logged in and can see it):

```yaml
default_context:
  author_name: Jimbob Briggs
  author_email: totallyrealemail@example.com
```

### Abbreviations

Deep in the docs with nary a mention are abbreviations, they make it convenient to select a template without thinking about it. `cookiecutter python` is a lot easier to type than `cookiecutter https://github.com/cadeef/cookiecutter-python.git`. I define it as:

```yaml
abbreviations:
  python: https://github.com/cadeef/cookiecutter-python.git
```

## Contributing

Matter of fact this is personal repo. It doesn‚Äôt aspire to best practices, though I try to stick to them, but instead what works for me. My aim is to show my process and possibly help you with yours.

If you‚Äôre using it, cool! We probably have similar methodologies and I‚Äôd love to hear about it. Raise an issue and let‚Äôs talk about it, you may have a great idea that I‚Äôd like to integrate into my workflow too.

Fork, make it yours. ‚ù§Ô∏è
